**Please Note:** 

- The IGEL App Creator portal runs the IGEL SDK to create and sign your application for OS12
- Currently, for security requirements, the IGEL App Creator Portal only allows for debian and ubuntu official repository URLs. IGEL is planning to allow for non-official URLs with a future release
- For OS 12.5.0+ need to have the app `Compatibility layer for 12.0.x apps` installed or you may get error message about app not found.
- UMS Web App - Apps Settings: `Download from UMS` and do not set `Block devices from downloading apps from the public App Portal as a fallback option` unless there is no internet access from OS 12 devices
