**Please Note:** 

- The IGEL App Creator portal runs the IGEL SDK to create and sign your application for OS12
- For security requirements, the IGEL App Creator Portal only allows for debian and ubuntu official repository URLs. Use the file upload feature to add file.
- For OS 12.5.0+ need to have the app `Compatibility layer for 12.0.x apps` installed
- UMS Web App - Apps Settings: `Download from UMS` and do not set `Block devices from downloading apps from the public App Portal as a fallback option` unless there is no internet access from OS 12 devices

## How to add links to /services/application_name

The App Creator Portal has automatic linking function that recognizes well-known folders that follow a common standard. Mostly libraries, desktop files, udev rules.

For special links, they are created by in a system service file. The path to place the file is:

```bash linenums="1"
input/all/etc/systemd/appname.service
```

If your recipe already has a .service file in our app just add a line:

```bash linenums="1"
ExecStartPre=/bin/ln -sf /services/citrix_nsgclient/opt/Citrix/NSGClient /opt/Citrix/NSGClient
```

Otherwise create a .service file with:

```bash linenums="1"
[Unit]
Description=My app Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/ln -sf /services/citrix_nsgclient/opt/Citrix/NSGClient /opt/Citrix/NSGClient
```
