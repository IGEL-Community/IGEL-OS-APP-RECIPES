**Please Note:** 

- The IGEL App Creator portal runs the IGEL SDK to create and sign your application for OS12
- For security requirements, the IGEL App Creator Portal only allows for debian and ubuntu official repository URLs. Use the file upload feature to add file.
- For OS 12.5.0+ need to have the app `Compatibility layer for 12.0.x apps` installed
- UMS Web App - Apps Settings: `Download from UMS` and do not set `Block devices from downloading apps from the public App Portal as a fallback option` unless there is no internet access from OS 12 devices

## Changing version in APP.JSON

- The technical version of the app is defined in the field `version`.

- The display version of the app is defined in the field `public_version`.

- The version numbers must comply with the [Semantic Versioning (SemVer) specifications](https://semver.org/)

- Version example used for IGEL OS Base OS:

```bash linenums="1"
      base_system-12.6.0
      base_system-12.6.0+1
      base_system-12.6.0+2
      base_system-12.6.1-0.tp.3
      base_system-12.6.1-0.tp.4
      base_system-12.6.1-1.rc.2
      base_system-12.6.1-1.rc.3
      base_system-12.7.0-0.tp.2
      base_system-12.7.0-0.tp.3
```

## How to add links to /services/application_name

The App Creator Portal has automatic linking function that recognizes well-known folders that follow a common standard. Mostly libraries, desktop files, udev rules.

For special links, they are created via a system service file. The path to place the file is:

```bash linenums="1"
input/all/etc/systemd/system/appname.service
```

If your recipe already has a .service file in our app just add a line:

```bash linenums="1"
ExecStartPre=/bin/ln -sf /services/citrix_nsgclient/opt/Citrix/NSGClient /opt/Citrix/NSGClient
```

Otherwise create a .service file with:

```bash linenums="1"
[Unit]
Description=My app Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/ln -sf /services/citrix_nsgclient/opt/Citrix/NSGClient /opt/Citrix/NSGClient
```

To enable the service create the file `igel/install.sh` and add:

```bash linenums="1"
#!/bin/bash
enable_system_service appname.service
```

-----

## Using Pre Package Commands

Pre packages commands can be placed into file `igel/pre_package_commands.sh`. This can be used to create files / folders as part of the recipe.

Example, used in recipe for `Topaz Systems SigPlus Pro C++ Object Library`, of using `igel/pre_package_commands.sh` to make a directory and create a file.

```bash linenums="1"
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p "%root%/etc/topaz"
cat <<"EOF" > "%root%/etc/topaz/topaz-init.sh"
#!/bin/bash
#set -x
#trap read debug

ACTION="app-topaz${1}"

# app path
APP_PATH="/services/topaz_sigplus_pro_c_object_library"

# output to systemlog with ID amd tag
LOGGER="logger -it ${ACTION}"

echo "Starting" | $LOGGER

# Linking files and folders on proper path
find ${APP_PATH} -printf "/%P\n" | while read DEST
do
  if [ ! -z "${DEST}" -a ! -e "${DEST}" ]; then
    # Remove the last slash, if it is a dir
    [ -d $DEST ] && DEST=${DEST%/} | $LOGGER
    if [ ! -z "${DEST}" ]; then
      ln -sv "${APP_PATH}/${DEST}" "${DEST}" | $LOGGER
    fi
  fi
done

echo "Finished" | $LOGGER

EOF
```

## Use prefer_btrfs file system for read / write partition

**Note:** Some apps may not work with non-btrfs file system for read / write partition. Applications, like 1Password and OneDrive, use SQLite, an Open-Source database program that uses a sub-set of the SQL database descriptor language, in their application and does not work with NTFS file system.

- In the `app.json` file set `prefer_btrfs` as the file system

```json
"rw_partition": {
  "size": "small",
  "flags": [
    "compressed",
    "prefer_btrfs"
  ]
}
```

- Check file system used for `/services_rw/*`

```bash linenums="1"
df -Th | grep services_rw
```
