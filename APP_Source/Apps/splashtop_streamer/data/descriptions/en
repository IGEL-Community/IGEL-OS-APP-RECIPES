Splashtop Streamer

Splashtop Streamer is a software component of the Splashtop remote-access
system that you install on a computer you want to access or control
remotely. It acts as the “server” side of the remote connection,
enabling another device (like your phone, tablet, or another PC) to see
and control the computer over a network or the Internet using a Splashtop
client app.
