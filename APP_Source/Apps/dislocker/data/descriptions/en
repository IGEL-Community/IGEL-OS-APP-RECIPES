Description: read/write encrypted BitLocker volumes

Dislocker has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions under a
Linux system. The driver used to read volumes encrypted in Windows system
versions of the Vista to 10 and BitLocker-To-Go encrypted partitions,
that's USB/FAT32 partitions.

The software works with driver composed of a library, with multiple
binaries using this library. Decrypting the partition, you have to give it
a mount point where, once keys are decrypted, a file named dislocker-file
appears.  This file is a virtual NTFS partition, so you can mount it as
any NTFS partition and then read from or write to it. Writing to the NTFS
virtual file will change the underlying BitLocker partition content. To
use dislocker-find Ruby is required.

This tool is useful in cryptography managing and forensics investigations.
