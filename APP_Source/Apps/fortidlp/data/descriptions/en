FortiDLP

FortiDLP protects organizations’ networks, devices, applications,
and data against insider and outsider threats. It blends active user
behavior analytics and data loss prevention technologies to accelerate
threat detection and response.

FortiDLP comprises the FortiDLP Infrastructure and the FortiDLP Agent:

The FortiDLP Infrastructure, which includes the frontend (known as
the FortiDLP Console), backend, database, and associated applications,
is deployed on-premises or to the FortiDLP Cloud.

The FortiDLP Agent collects granular behavioral information and reports
it back to the FortiDLP Infrastructure for security threat analysis.
