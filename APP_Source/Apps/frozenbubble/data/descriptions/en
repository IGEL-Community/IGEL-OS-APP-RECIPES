cool game where you pop out the bubbles!

Frozen-Bubble is a clone of the popular "Puzzle Bobble" game, in which you attempt to shoot bubbles into groups of the same color to cause them to pop.

Players compete as penguins and must use the arrow keys to aim a colored bubble at groups of bubbles. The objective is to clear all the bubbles off the screen before a bubble passes below a line at the bottom.

It features 100 single-player levels, a two-player mode, music and striking graphics. A level editor is also included to allow players to create and play their own levels.
