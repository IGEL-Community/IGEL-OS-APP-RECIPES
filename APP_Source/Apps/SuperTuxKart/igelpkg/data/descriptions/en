3D arcade racer with a variety of characters, tracks, and modes to play

Karts. Nitro. Action! SuperTuxKart is a 3D open-source arcade racer with a
variety of characters, tracks, and modes to play. The aim is to create a
game that is more fun than realistic, and provide an enjoyable experience
for all ages.

Discover the mystery of an underwater world, or drive through the jungles
of Val Verde and visit the famous Cocoa Temple. Race underground or in a
spaceship, through a rural farmland or a strange alien planet.
Or rest under the palm trees on the beach, watching the other karts
overtake you. But don't eat the bananas! Watch for bowling balls,
plungers, bubble gum, and cakes thrown by your opponents.

You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several
Grand Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play
battle mode against the computer or your friends, and more! For a greater
challenge, race online against players from all over the world and prove
your racing prowess!
