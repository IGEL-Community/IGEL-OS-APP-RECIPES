Cross Platform Password Manager

KeePassXC is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.

In contrast to KeePassX (package keepassx), KeePassXC is actively developed and has more features, e.g., connectivity to a Web Browser plugin (package webext-keepassxc-browser).
