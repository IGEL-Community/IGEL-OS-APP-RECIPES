complete Mono runtime, development tools and all libraries

Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin. Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language) bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.

This is a metapackage and pulls in the Mono runtime, development tools and all libraries.
