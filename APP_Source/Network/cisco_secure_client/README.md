# Cisco Secure Client

This is a small guide for the IGEL Cisco Secure Client app.

## User settings

User settings which can be configure in the UI will be stored persistently on the read/write partition (/services_rw/cisco_secure_client/userhome/.vpn/.anyconnect) and should survive reboots.

## Custom Profiles

In order to deploy a custom profile (xml), add it to your UMS as 'Undefined' file and transfer it to your managed devices.

The path, the file is transferred to does not really matter but you have to make sure, the setupd parameter 'Profile directory' (app.cisco_secure_client.config.profile_dir) is set to the same location.

The profile will then be permanently stored on the read/write partition at /services_rw/cisco_secure_client/profile and linked to the Secure Client profile directory (/services/cisco_secure_client/opt/cisco/secureclient/vpn/profile/).
